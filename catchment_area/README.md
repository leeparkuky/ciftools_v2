# CIFTools/catchment_areas

This branch contains files with county names and associated FIPS codes for the statistical catchment areas of each NCI-designated Cancer Center. The file `all_catchment_areas.csv` summarizes all of the catchment areas and gives the key for the shortnames used to name individual files. There is also a PDF detailing all of the catchment areas, and CSVs giving names and FIPS for all US counties and all US states.

If you need to construct your own catchment area file, you can use the `all_counties.csv` file as a reference and delete all the counties you don't need. You can also copy-and-paste the counties you need from `all_counties.csv` (or the website https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697) into the blank `template_ca.csv` file.
